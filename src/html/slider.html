            I’ve only been playing this game for three weeks, and I’ve fallen in love. This game is a masterpiece and here’s
            why It’s easy to get characters.  I don’t see that in  many games. 
            <span class="reviews__slider-review-hidden">You don’t overprice offers in the shop.The game is fun, considering it has several game modes which
            contains lots of entertainment. This game is perfect since game only take max 3 to 4 minutes. </span>

            My favorite Supercell game
            I’m was a beta player so I’ve been playing Brawl Stars for a while and i will never stopped. <span class="reviews__slider-review-hidden">I have played all of
            Supercells games, but these one is the best because it’s fast and not nearly as pay to win as what some of
            these reviews say. I do agree that pay to win is a much bigger thing the lower you are.</span>

            In all Brawl Stars is a very strategic game because you aren’t just saying where you want your fire power to go. But when, how, how much, and at which angle. <span class="reviews__slider-review-hidden">You don’t have to rely on some AI to attack for you (well, unless your teammate leaves) but rather trust your instincts.  This is what make Brawl Stars Supercells best game. It a great game for 3 yo and up.</span>

            A pretty decent game all around. Lots of content with lots of different characters to use and lots of different game modes to play.
            Brawl Stars is very fun game to enjoy. <span class="reviews__slider-review-hidden">I’ve had this game for about a year now. When I first got it I played for a bit and then stopped, but after a recent discovery after all these months, safe to say it’s my favorite mobile game.</span>
